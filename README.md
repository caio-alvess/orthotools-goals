# Orthotools - Goals

Orthotools is a set of tools I created to automate my daily work. Orthotools solves **specific problems**, primarily designed to make my and my co-workers' days easier.

## What does it solve?

Before Orthotools, workers were expected to perform their own calculations, and managers had to create their own spreadsheet reports. With Orthotools, their jobs become faster, more secure, and easier.

**In short, Orthotools empowers the team by streamlining tasks, reducing errors, and boosting productivity.**
